# Inventory Logger
Welcome to a personal passion project!
Having spent a few years in retail arbitrage, and over a decade in collecting odds and ends
I have decided to create a Python program that allows me to take inventory
of all the stuff I have amassed.  From Sneakers, to Vinyl, CD's, and an assortment
of other collectibles, I needed a fool-proof way to track what I own, as well
as how much I spent, and how much it was worth! 

# Usage
Currently, the program will allow you to input information on the item in your collection, such as
purchase date, price, quantity, sku, etc. and input this information into an organized csv.  Eventually, 
I have plans to pick up a barcode scanner to make most of this input a little more streamlined.

This is my first crack at Python, so there may be a myriad of mistakes and room for improvement, but his
project is not only for my personal use but also my way of learning Python more fluently.

# Requirements
Python
Pandas
# How to use

run python main.py
follow the prompts for the item that you are entering
